      <p>
        I'm a software engineer and recent graduate of Fullstack's Coding
        Bootcamp. Prior to transitioning to software development, I owned a
        business as a hairstylist. While starting my business, a friend helped
        me create a website, which sparked my interest in this field. I was
        drawn to hairdressing because it allowed me to make a difference and
        solve problems creatively. Now, I'm excited to bring those skills to my
        new career.

        In addition to my passion for software development, I have a deep
        interest in music and the outdoors. I enjoy playing various musical
        instruments in my free time. Music has always been a source of
        inspiration and creativity for me, and I believe it enhances my
        problem-solving abilities and open-mindedness. Enthusiast of the great
        outdoors, I thrive on the beauty and serenity of nature. Whether
        summiting peaks, scaling rock faces, cruising mountain trails, or
        uncovering hidden gems in rocky landscapes, I find boundless joy in
        every adventure. The thrill of hiking, rock climbing, and mountain
        biking connects me with the environment in ways words can't capture.
        Nature isn't just a place I goâ€”it's woven into my soul, a source of
        solace, challenge, and endless fascination.
