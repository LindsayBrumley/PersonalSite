    <main class="bio">
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer and recent graduate of Fullstack's Coding
        Bootcamp. Prior to transitioning to software development, I owned a
        business as a hairstylist. While starting my business, a friend helped
        me create a website, which sparked my interest in this field. I was
        drawn to hairdressing because it allowed me to make a difference and
        solve problems creatively. Now, I'm excited to bring those skills to my
        new career.

        In addition to my passion for software development, I have a deep
        interest in music. I enjoy playing various musical instruments in my
        free time. Music has always been a source of inspiration and creativity
        for me, and I believe it enhances my problem-solving abilities and
        open-mindedness.

        My strengths lie in effective communication, a strong willingness to
        learn, and emotional intelligence. I specialize in JavaScript
        technologies for both frontend and backend development. Continuously
        challenging myself to explore new areas and expand my knowledge and
        skills, I am eager to find my niche in the industry
